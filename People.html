    <p class="lead">In this video, we learned about the after effects of the bubble era and new platforms created with the focus on people and communication. Websites like Youtube, Facebook, Diggs,Myspace, Napster, Wikipedia, and Craiglist all were created for users to gain a little access to power through the web. </p>
    <p class ="lead"> Youtube was founded by Chad Harley, and gave users an ability to broadcast their own content without being a well known celebrity. Diggs founded by Kevin Rose was a news outlet where users could post the news they wanted and have it on the same platform as New York Times. These sites started the trend for platforms to adhere to your normal person.</p>

<p class="lead">Later came social media platforms, mp3, and music sharing. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of facebook created the site with the goal of giving people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Also, David Weekly, Cabel Sasser, Justin Frankl founded mp3 which is essentially compressed music packets that allow music to be played on computers. This invention reduced the trouble of going to record stores and listen to cds, to access your favorite music. With this invention, Shawn Fanning created Napster which ultimately allowed people to access a library of different mp3 for free.
</p>
    <p class="lead"> These sites were not popular for record companies. This led to Napster shut down, and youtube needing the help of Google to avoid the same faith. Even with these setbacks, user driven sites still have a strong hold on the country. Craig Newmark and Jimmy Wales, were still able to create the sites Craiglist and Wikipedia. Myspace and Facebook battled for social media dominance. Fast forward, we see the positive effects of these sites and how the world is driven by these applications on the internet.
