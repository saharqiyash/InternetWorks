    <p class="lead">The Internet is the defining technology of our time And historic revolution in communications for the human race that is changing the world. The Internet enables millions of people with personal computers to communicate and connect. It is also the world's largest marketplace and shopping mall and it’s a link to websites the world over with information for every aspect of life and even the life after.catchphrases to discover significant outcomes. At whatever point a user entered a search term, search engines, for example, AltaVista and Lycos would contrast the inquiry term with their information bases of terms. The pages that had text generally like the hunt term were viewed as more important and were highlighted higher in the rundown of searched items. This didn't generally demonstrate helpful outcomes and improved search engines for example Yahoo and Google were found in 1994 and 1998 individually. </p>
    <p class ="lead"> The Internet is a global network of computer-based communication. Millions of people around the world are now using the Internet every day to exchange messages, conduct business, meet people, and find information.</p>

<p class="lead"> he Internet is practically indispensable yet it’s origin states back only to the 1950s. The idea behind the Internet was envisioned by a psychologist named JCR Licklider, A professor at the Massachusetts Institute of technology in the 1950s. His vision was that computers would allow you to communicate better and that would allow you to connect all the computers together so that they might be more useful in the sharing of information among people
</p>
    <p class="lead"> The first computers were monstrously large and expensive devices that were never intended to communicate. Well America gave birth to a space program that grew from a call to run by presidential edict, computer communication was in the embryonic stage but it was making progress.
</p>
    <p class="lead"> At MIT a graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock began applying queuing theory to data transmission. It is a tool for evaluating computer and communication systems. He also implemented the two techniques called demand access and distributed control. </p>
    <p class="lead"> His theory proved that computer communication could one day be a reality and it also marked a revolutionary departure from the telephone systems use of a technology called circuit switching. This was a benefit for the American national security, as they hired Paul Baran to figure out a way to work through the networks and use data to track calls. In the Late 1960’s the new big idea was something called time sharing. </p>
    <p class="lead">  In 1966, Bob Taylor from ARPA (Advanced Research Project Agency), Needed a separate terminal to log into each of several shared computers that research centers across the Country. Taylor recruited Larry Roberts for the job, in which Roberts had built the world's first experimental connection between two computers. In 1971 Raymond Tomlinson Invented the electronic mail system By putting two programs together, modifying the code and the first email program was created. </p>
    <p class="lead"> He also gave the world a new icon for the information age which is known as the “@“. In June 1992, Congress passed a bill taking the Internet out of the exclusive hands of the government and into the public. The following November President Bush signed it into law. By the late 90s the Internet had grown in simplicity of use, complexity of Performance, and multiplicity of information. It has completely redefined the use of personal computers.
