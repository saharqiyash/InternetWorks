    <p class="lead">In this video we learn about the Dot Com bubble era, where e-commerce startups were taking over the economy, causing investors to spend millions of dollars on various different products. Two websites that pioneered this revolution were Amazon and Ebay. For Amazon, we learn how they grew to the massive titan, they are today, also how quickly it all happened for them.  </p>
    <p class ="lead"> Amazon was founded in a garage by Jeff Bezos, in Seattle Washington. The purpose of amazon at first was to sell books and become one of the biggest online bookstores. It launched in the summer of 1995. Along with Amazon, Pierre Omidayar developed a website called Ebay, with the goal of online market/auction with an even field for everyone to bid away.</p>

<p class="lead"> Amazon coined the strategy called Get Big Fast or GBF, which means pricing low and marketing heavily to build a user base. This strategy was very effective due to the r growth of the internet, gaining about 15 million users in five years.
</p>
    <p class="lead"> This rapid growth of Amazon and Ebay caused people to invest heavily in their stock, not only their stock but any with a .com on it. Companies invested millions of dollars into e-commerce, web developers getting 400 million dollar checks just for the ability to build sites, in hopes of being the next amazon. Wall street and Silicon Valley became the homes of this bubble era. However, a lot of these e-commerce sites failed to replicate amazon and ebay success and on Black Friday stock markets for Nasdaq crash potentially ending the bubble era.
