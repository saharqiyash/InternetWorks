    <h1>IP Addresses</h1>
    <p class="lead"> An IP address, or simply an "IP," is a unique address that identifies a device on the
        Internet or a local network. It allows a system to be recognized by other systems connected via the
        Internet protocol. There are two primary types of IP address formats used today — IPv4 and IPv6. </p>

    <h3>IPv4</h3>
    <p class="lead">An IPv4 address consist of four sets of numbers from 0 to 255, separated by three dots.
        For example, the IP address of TechTerms.com is 67.43.14.98. This number is used to identify the TechTerms
        website on the Internet.</p>

    <h3>IPv6</h3>
    <p class="lead">IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, which identifies devices across the internet
        so they can be located. Every device that uses the internet is identified through its own IP address in order
        for internet communication to work. In that respect, it’s just like the street addresses and zip codes you need
        to know in order to mail a letter.</p>

    <h1>Packets</h1>
    <p class="lead">A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet.
        Similar to a real-life package, each packet includes a source and destination as well as the content
        (or data) being transferred. When the packets reach their destination, they are reassembled into a single
        file or other contiguous block of data.</p>
    <p class="lead">Packets are intended to transfer data reliably and efficiently. Instead of transferring a large
        file as a single block of data, sending smaller packets helps ensure each section is transmitted successfully.
        If a packet is not received or is "dropped," only the dropped packet needs to be resent. Additionally, if a
        data transfer encounters network congestion due to multiple simultaneous transfers, the remaining packets can
        be rerouted through a less congested path.</p>
    <h1>Routing</h1>
    <p class="lead">Routing is the process of moving a packet of data from source to destination. Routing is usually
        performed by a dedicated device called a router. Routing is a key feature of the Internet because it enables
        messages to pass from one computer to another and eventually reach the target machine. Each intermediary
        computer performs routing by passing along the message to the next computer. Part of this process involves
        analyzing a routing tablet determine the best path. Routing is often confused with bridging, which performs a
        similar function. The principal difference between the two is that bridging occurs at a lower level and is
        therefore more of a hardware function whereas routing occurs at a higher level where the software component
        is more important. And because routing occurs at a higher level, it can perform more complex analysis to
        determine the optimal path for the packet.
